This project is to build an Artificial Neural Network using Keras to predict
the customers of a bank which are most likely to churn(leave the bank) or stay based
on the features of a customer such as Credit Score, Balance, Active Cards, Gender,
Geography,etc.

The dataset used for this model is :
Churn_Modelling.csv

The code is written on python notebook file :
git_churn_modelling_ann.ipynb
